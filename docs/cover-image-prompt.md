# Cover Image Generation Prompt

## For AI Image Generation (Midjourney/DALL-E/Stable Diffusion)

### Primary Prompt - "The Platform Construction Site"

```
Editorial photo-illustration in Bloomberg Businessweek style, aerial 3/4 view of a modern construction site building five glass towers, sharp architectural photography mixed with hand-drawn pencil illustrations, one completed photorealistic glass tower labeled "AI Gateway" with three tiny cartoon AI characters (robot, brain, stars) on the roof competing, four other towers are just pencil sketch outlines on blueprint paper fading into the photo, construction workers for scale, a crisp $10 bill being fed into an illustrated "token meter" machine, MacBook Pro on construction table showing green terminal code, desaturated color palette with selective bright green on the working tower, steel beams and cranes frame the composition, professional architectural photography base with 30% editorial illustration overlay, high contrast, clean minimalist style, no text overlays --ar 16:9 --style raw --v 6
```

### Alternative Prompt - "The Empty Boardroom"

```
Photo-illustration hybrid, New York Times editorial style, modern tech company boardroom with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking city, five Herman Miller chairs around glass conference table, black and white photography with selective color, four chairs have ghostly pencil-sketch outlines of absent features sitting in them labeled "Queues (On Leave)", "Sandbox (In Beta)", "Micro-frontends (Enterprise Only)", "BotID (Invite Only)", one chair has a bright holographic green figure labeled "AI Gateway" actually present, hand-drawn $10 bill with wings floating above the table, dramatic lighting through windows creating long shadows, 70% photography 30% illustration, sophisticated minimalist composition --ar 16:9 --style raw
```

### Simplified Prompt for Quick Generation

```
Bloomberg style photo-illustration, construction site building 5 features but only 1 is real, 4 are pencil sketches, $10 bill constraint, developer with laptop, editorial illustration mixed with photography, desaturated with green accent --ar 16:9
```

## For Commissioning a Designer/Illustrator

### Creative Brief

**Style Reference**: Bloomberg Businessweek, New York Times Business section, The Economist technology features

**Concept**: "Building in the Gap Between Promise and Product" - A photo-illustration showing the reality that only 1 of 5 promised features actually shipped

**Key Elements**:
1. **Photography Base (70%)**:
   - Real construction site or modern office building under construction
   - Actual MacBook/laptop showing terminal with code
   - Physical $10 bill (crisp, new)
   - Professional architectural/documentary photography style

2. **Illustration Overlay (30%)**:
   - 5 towers/features being built, but only 1 (AI Gateway) is photographically real
   - Other 4 features are pencil sketches on blueprint paper, fading/ghostly
   - Small illustrated AI characters (representing Grok, Claude, Gemini) on the completed tower
   - The $10 bill being fed into an illustrated "token meter" or similar constraint visualization
   - Hand-drawn architectural elements and annotations

3. **Color Treatment**:
   - Mostly desaturated/black and white photography
   - Selective color on the one working feature (bright green or blue)
   - Blueprint blue for sketched elements
   - High contrast, editorial feel

4. **Composition**:
   - Aerial or 3/4 view to show scope
   - Clear visual hierarchy: 1 real vs 4 promised
   - Space for subtle text integration if needed
   - Professional, sophisticated, not cartoonish

**Deliverables**: High-res image suitable for LinkedIn article header (1200x627px minimum), with layered file for potential adjustments

**Tone**: Sophisticated critique, not cynical. Shows the gap between promise and delivery while acknowledging the one feature that works beautifully.

## For Photography Direction

If shooting custom photography for the base:

**Shot List**:
1. Construction site with 5 foundation areas (aerial drone or elevated angle)
2. Clean desk setup with MacBook showing terminal, $10 bill placed intentionally
3. Modern office/conference room with 5 chairs or workstations
4. Shipping port with containers (if going with shipping metaphor)

**Notes**:
- Leave negative space for illustration overlay
- Shoot with harsh lighting for strong shadows (adds drama)
- Include real $10 bill in frame for scale/constraint reference
- Ensure terminal shows actual code from the project
