I spent $10 on Vercel's Ship 2025 features. 

What I found reveals a truth about "shipping" in tech.

Ship implies readiness. Ship implies deployment. Ship implies "it works."

But here's what actually happened:

✅ AI Gateway: Works beautifully. Multi-model orchestration in one line.
❌ Queues: "Limited beta" = doesn't exist
❌ Sandbox: "Public beta" = no API access  
❌ Micro-frontends: Enterprise only, limited to 3
❌ BotID: Invite only

5 features announced. 1 actually shippable.

So we built something anyway.

An AI showdown that orchestrates Grok, Claude, and Gemini in real-time. With animations. With cost tracking. With automated judging.

24 hours of work for features that mostly don't exist.

Why? Because that's what builders do.

We don't wait for perfect platforms. We build with what works.

The irony? Cloudflare's AI Gateway has caching, rate limiting, load balancing, and failover. Today. Not "coming soon."

Invariant Labs (Snyk) offers agent tracing and guardrails. Today. Not "limited beta."

But here's why this matters:

Vercel spotted the right need. AI developers need gateways. They need sandboxes. They need queues.

The vision is correct. The execution is... shipping.

So I'm open-sourcing everything. The working code. The failed attempts. The workarounds.

Because the best way to push platforms forward is to show what's possible with constraints.

See what $10 teaches about AI economics.
See why "Ship" should mean "It ships."
See how we turned 20% feature availability into 100% learning.

The future of AI development needs better infrastructure.

Until then, we build.
