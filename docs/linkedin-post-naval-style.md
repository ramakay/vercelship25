Vercel announced Ship 2025. I spent 24 hours building with it. Now you can spend what's left of my $10.

Every platform promises the future. Few deliver the present.

Ship implies deployment. Ship implies it works. Ship implies you can use it today.

5 features announced. 1 actually accessible.

AI Gateway works beautifully. One line to switch between models. This shipped.
Queues don't exist. "Limited beta" means no access.
Sandbox has no API. "Public beta" means documentation only.
Micro-frontends need Enterprise. Limited to 3.
BotID requires an invite. Might as well be fiction.

So I built anyway.

An AI showdown orchestrating Grok, Claude, and Gemini. Real-time streaming. Cost tracking. Automated judging. All with the 20% that worked.

The repository is public. The code is yours. My remaining budget is yours.

Why open source this? Because working code teaches what documentation cannot.

See the workarounds. Understand the constraints. Learn why animations solve async UX problems.

Meanwhile, Cloudflare ships AI Gateway with caching, rate limiting, load balancing. Today.
Invariant Labs ships agent tracing and guardrails. Today.

The gap between announcement and availability is where builders live.

As an Agentic architect, I see patterns. Platforms spot the right problems. AI needs gateways. Developers need orchestration. The vision is perfect.

The execution is... shipping.

Ship should mean it ships.

My $10 taught me more than $10,000 in credits would. Constraints create clarity.

You can run my experiment. Spend my remaining budget. Fork the repo. Build something real.

The best critique of a platform is building on it anyway.

Welcome to the frontier. Where we build with what exists, not what's promised.
