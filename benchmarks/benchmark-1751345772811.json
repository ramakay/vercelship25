Feature Availability Probe - Gateway ping, Sandbox ping, Queue probe, record in /status.json\\n2. Chat Orchestrator Flow - Parallel calls to 3 models, capture latency/tokens/cost, return ranked results\\n3. Model Evaluation & Benchmarking - evaluateResponse() scoring: Relevance (0-10), Reasoning (0-5), Style (0-5), Total Score = Relevance × 2 + Reasoning + Style + (-Latency/1000) + (-Cost×10)\\n4. UI - Prompt box, results table with scores, sandbox output, cumulative cost tracker\\n5. Cost Logging - Queue if available, else localStorage\\n6. Screenshots & Data Export - Playwright automation, Functions/Gateway metrics CSV\\n\\nKey files: /app/api/chat/route.ts (orchestrator), /app/bench/evaluate.ts (judge prompts), /app/components/ResultsTable.tsx\\n\\nSuccess: ≤$10 total cost, 3 models with scores, auto-ranked winner, sandbox execution, exported metrics.",
